# Hasher.sh - File Hash Checker

## Overview
Hasher.sh is a simple Bash script designed to calculate file hashes (MD5, SHA1) and optionally check them against online threat intelligence databases like VirusTotal. This tool helps identify potentially malicious files by cross-referencing their hashes with known malware databases.

## Features
- Computes **MD5** and **SHA1** hashes for a given file.
- Option to check file hashes against online databases.
- Supports VirusTotal CLI for quick malware analysis.
- Simple command-line interface for ease of use.

## Prerequisites
Before running `hasher.sh`, ensure you have the following installed:
- Bash (default on most Linux/macOS systems)
- `md5sum` and `sha1sum` (usually pre-installed)
- [VirusTotal CLI](https://github.com/VirusTotal/vt-cli) (optional, for online checks)

## Installation
Clone or download the script and make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x hasher.sh
```

## Usage
Run the script with the file you want to check:
```bash
./hasher.sh <file_path>
```

### Example:
```bash
./hasher.sh sample.exe
```
Output:
```
This application will check the file hashes and crosscheck with databases online to see if it is malicious or not.

Do you want to check this file online? (y/n):
```

## Online Check (VirusTotal)
If you choose **y**, the script will use VirusTotal CLI to check the file hash:
```bash
vt file report <hash>
```
This requires you to have VirusTotal CLI set up with an API key.

## Future Improvements
- Add support for SHA256 hashing.
- Check against additional threat intelligence platforms (e.g., AbuseIPDB, HybridAnalysis).
- Improve error handling and add logging capabilities.
